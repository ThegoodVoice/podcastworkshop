You just recorded that great podcast episode. Maybe you finally booked that big-name guest you wanted, but more likely you had a genuine conversation with someone your audience would appreciate. Perhaps you just recorded your solo show or co-host chat about the subject you could spend days on.
Now comes the time to make it sound better for the world to enjoy.
Listening back - you hear all the crutch words, the weird audio anomaly, or maybe it just took a second take mid-session to get the gold out.
‚Ä¶or maybe you don‚Äôt want to listen back immediately to knock you down off your post-recording high. Ug, but you have to get that episode out!
I get that. Get it a lot actually.
I probably even hear the things you don‚Äôt that destroys podcast flow. I have the tools to do the job and the skills to get it done. I have this passion for great conversational audio that others outside our shared industry may think borders on obsession.
Why, because I‚Äôm a Professional Podcast Editor.

Luckily, our clients don‚Äôt think my obsession is all that bad.
[Testimonial]
I‚Äôm like that trusted member of your family that somehow hears the siren before you do. Sometimes I‚Äôm like your friend that sits next to you in the movie theater that winces on a bad cut (or marvels how they setup the next action).
Specifically, this is what I do
+ Bullet list of CONCISE editing attributes.
+ The more the merrier.
+ Such as EQ
+ Leveling would be next
+ The other copy is for those that think qualitatively
+ this list is for the quantitative thinkers
[Testimonial]
You know your time is spent best on the mic, promoting your past episodes, lining up future ones, or being a guest on similar shows (MARK‚Äôs bias here).
Do exactly that.
Let‚Äôs work in parallel to get more done and bring better content to your growing audience.
I‚Äôm not a cartoon avatar on fiverr. I‚Äôm here ‚Äì and so are you. Ready to get started?

***
Testimonial‚Äôs are not hard. They can be easy to get and impactful to use if you give your current clients direction. A simple 1,2,3 punch works.
(1) I had a *problem/worry/concern*. (2) YOUR NAME/COMPANY did *what*. (3) I know get to enjoy *benefit*.
